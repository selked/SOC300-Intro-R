# Preface {.unnumbered}

Welcome to this introductory R tutorial for SOC 300!

Here you will find all the step-by-step instructions for completing our initial foray into R for quantitative analysis of social science data. We will begin by establishing some common ground in basic R operations and functionality. After we lay this foundation, we will progress through various data processing tasksâ€”from importing and cleaning public data to visualizing and analyzing these data for consumption by interested stakeholders. 

You will receive an R script file with the commands detailed here, so that you can easily run and manipulate them on your own device, but you will always be able to refer to this mini-textbook in the event that you would like to see everything in one place and refer to some more detailed documentation on various R operations.
